Possible ways to address this:

  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore this particular directory.
  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore one of its parent directories.
  * Rename the directory to comply with the naming conventions.
  * Modify the inflector to handle this case.

Zeitwerk::NameError (wrong constant name V1.0 inferred by Module from directory

  C:/RubyWebService/eleos-web-service-ruby/app/controllers/api/v1.0

Possible ways to address this:

  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore this particular directory.
  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore one of its parent directories.
  * Rename the directory to comply with the naming conventions.
  * Modify the inflector to handle this case.
